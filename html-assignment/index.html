            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is <em>Christianah Ogunmuyiwa,</em> a student of Interactive Media design at Algonquin College.
                I am a newcomer Canadian with no Canadian experience which made getting a job in my field of previous
                study difficult. With the pandemic came an increase in demand for the web and I realized it was a good
                time to switch career and start over.
            </p>

            <p>
                While I hold a master’s degree in Geographic Information Systems and a bachelor’s degree in Geography
                and Environmental management, I hope to someday be very good at coding in HTML, CSS, Java Script,
                Python, Java, and PHP. I am also currently taking some Photography and Photo editing classes, which I
                hope will help me in taking great fashion photographs of my designs as I hope to own a fashion and
                design business, soon.This <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> code is my 1<sup>st</sup>
                code.
            </p>
